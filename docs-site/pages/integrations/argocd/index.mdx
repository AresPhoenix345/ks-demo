# ArgoCD Integration

The ArgoCD integration connects KubeStellar BindingPolicies to Argo CD. For each destination in a BindingPolicy (or resolved Binding), the controller creates or updates an Argo CD Application so that GitOps sync applies to the right clusters.

## Features

- **BindingPolicy → Applications** — One Argo CD Application per destination cluster
- **Template-based** — Define source (repo, path, revision) and sync policy once; controller fills in destination per cluster
- **Status** — Optional sync status from Argo CD back to ArgoCDBinding

## Quick Start

1. Install KubeStellar and Argo CD.
2. Install the ArgoCD integration CRD and controller (see [Installation](/integrations/argocd/installation)).
3. Create a BindingPolicy that selects your clusters and workload objects.
4. Create an ArgoCDBinding that references the BindingPolicy and defines the Application template.
5. The controller creates/updates Argo CD Applications for each destination.
